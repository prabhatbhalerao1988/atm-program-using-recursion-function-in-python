Recursive Function (atm_menu)
The atm_menu function is defined to handle the ATM menu logic.
After each action (check balance, deposit, withdraw), the function calls itself again if the user has not chosen to exit (option 4). This is the recursive call.
When the user selects option 4 (case '4'), the function returns and the recursion stops. This ends the ATM program.
